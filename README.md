## About This Repository

This repository contains scripts and other files needed to reproduce all the figures from Moyung et. al (2024). Processed BAM files and downstream data are available in GEO under the accession number GSE263367 ([https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/)). 

All figures require a master data table that is generated by running ```Combine_Mutant_Quantifications.Rmd``` (in the Functions directory of this repo) on the downloaded data from GEO.
